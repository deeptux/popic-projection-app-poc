name: ETL Engine RLIP RAP Merge
overview: Extend the ingestion engine to support three spreadsheet types (combined RLIP+RAP, RLIP-only, RAP-only), detect table start under header blocks, use table Month/Year as authoritative period with filename/header captured for discrepancy notes, and merge separate RLIP+RAP files with same-period checksum; output structured metadata for a future assistant.
